The BowlingScoreKeeper project was written in C# language using .NET Core 2.2 and JetBrains Rider. 

Added new validation that checks if both bowls for each frame are less or equal to 10. The score cards are also updated with new format.

The logic of Score Keeper is very simple:
1. Each player has one game
2. The game consists of 10 frames
3. Each frame has 2 throws and a score
4. You call StartApp to begin the program
5. You call ScoreCard to show the results
